In this folder, the **"Cite_fake.csv"** and **"Review.csv"** are the original dataset in the Lab1

In the **processed_data** folder, there are our new datasets for creating the knowledge graph.

The **Data_Reprocessing.ipynb** and **Generate_Additional_Attributes.ipynb** are for generating the new datasets, and the **Checking.ipynb** is for checking if part of the knowledge graph statistics is the same as the tabular data format.
